👋  Hi there!
- 💞️  I'm a recent CS grad whose main areas of interest are music, AI, audio programming, and blockchain development
- 🌱  Lately I’ve been having fun learning the JUCE framework and working toward building audio applications involving reverb, delays, and pitch shifting; you can check out some of my music at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFxb7Z8LSTJYA_R69IRAqQ
- 👀  I'm currently seeking a C/C++ developer role, and I'm looking forward to being part of a great team
- 📫  You can reach me at john@johnreynolds3d.com

Cheers!
